Source: Group-IB
Date: 2023-08-25

Group-IB's Threat Intelligence unit has discovered a new campaign exploiting CVE-2023-38831, a zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR. Attackers distribute malicious .ZIP and .RAR archives via phishing emails to traders on public forums. 

When a victim opens a benign file (like a .jpg or .txt) from within the crafted archive, a malicious script is executed in the background. This tactic falls under T1204.002 (User Execution: Malicious File). The payload often includes commodity malware like DarkMe, GuLoader, and Remcos RAT.
