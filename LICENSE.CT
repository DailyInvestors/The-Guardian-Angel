"Idea": Refers to the conceptual framework, underlying principles, business model, functional concepts, or any general concepts embodied or illustrated by the Project, distinct from the specific implementation or expression of those concepts.

Important Notes and Cautions for You:

Legal Advice is Essential: I am an AI, not a lawyer. This license is a template. You MUST consult with a qualified attorney specializing in intellectual property and software licensing to tailor this document to your specific needs, jurisdiction, and project.
"No Trouble" is Impossible: Reiterate: No license can prevent lawsuits or regulatory action if you act negligently or unlawfully, especially concerning data security. The "Limitation of Liability" section aims to minimize financial exposure but doesn't prevent being sued.
Enforceability: The enforceability of clauses like "no use of idea" can be challenging. Courts typically protect expressions (copyright, patent) rather than abstract ideas. The language here tries to push the boundary by linking the idea to the specific "Designs" and "Project" which are protected.
Maintenance and Updates: The security of your project will depend on your ongoing maintenance, patching, and adherence to security best practices. A license doesn't absolve you of this responsibility.
User Agreement: Ensure that users explicitly agree to this license (e.g., via a click-wrap agreement before downloading/using the software).
